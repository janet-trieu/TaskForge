Week 1

Formed our groups in tutorial, setup Jira, Github and communication between group members
Dabin is scrum master since he has experience with Jira and similar software, everyone else is currently developer

First online meeting was done on sunday, discussed - 
Jira usage and familarising for task management project, high level system architecture and roles as well as
discussion on what an MVP might look like. Questions for the tutor at next tutorial at what an MVP could be

Only joseph has had frontend experience, so hes doing frontend, however 1 person is probably not enough, so janet
volunteered to learn and help him out when the time comes. Things to do before next tut is to properly read the specs
and come up with ideas for novel features. Dabin already had one in mind, we just need 1 more

============================================================================================================================

Week 2

Worked out majority of our functionalities/features in wednesday meeting and sunday meeting. Came up with reputation and
achievements/milestones as novelty features. We decided to use react express for frontend, python flask for backend, postgresql
for the database. I came up with a very rough sql schema for tasks and taskmaskers. Janet made some mockups for the website layout
and each page. 
I finished the background portion of the proposal, may need to rewrite as things change. Dabin, Francis and I worked on user stories
after the sunday meeting, creating them and separating them into sprints.
Added the tasks on jira

============================================================================================================================

Week 3

We revised our novel functionalities to be more complex, especially the reputation system due to tutor feedback. 
We decided to use firebase instead of a local postgresql database since it was probably easier, and it could provide
authentication, so we didnt have to implement it ourselves. 
I added more to the background portion of the proposal to better engage with the marking critera.
We also named our project taskForge. I added our sprint 3 user stories into the jira roadmap.


============================================================================================================================

Week 4

I was given the task of figuring out how firebase worked, how to use it and how to get started with the backend, mainly
with the database. Joseph had a similar task, but he focused alot more on firebase authentication. 
I spent some time messing around with it, and came up with 2 testing files in firebase_test branch that showed
how to access the database and manipulate data within it and also read from it. 
We also split up different functionalities to work on, I took admin. I wrote the tests and implemented the functions
Much discussion took place about how user ids could work, and we are yet to iron out the details. Also talk about 
firebase auth, and if we should keep using it. I believe we are going to keep it, since joseph can use cloud functions to do
things we thought we could not.

The sprint ends very soon, and it does not look like we'll finish in time, so some issues may have to be pushed to sprint 2

============================================================================================================================

Week 5

We demoed our Sprint 1 to our tutor, which was missing some frontend implementation, and we also had our retrospective on the
same day after the tut. Since then, we divided up sprint 2 into functionalities just like in sprint 1 and I got connection
management.

I came across some annoying import errors which took some time to debug with help from the team, but I got through it. HTTP tests
for connection management also took some time, as I didn't know you could have multi method routes like "GET", "POST".
Janet just brought up an issue of tests running in random order, so we may have to change tests for that, since some tests rely
on previous tests to work properly.

We still have to work on the retrospective, and finish more functionalities in sprint 2.

============================================================================================================================

Week 6

I finished the connection management functions, unit testing and http testing, janet filled out the retrospective and it was 
okayed by everyone so that was submitted.

Dabin ran into issues on his own machine, although no one else had the same issues, causing tests to not work properly. So he will
have to work on VLAB/TigerVNC from now on :/. Francis was unsure about file download and upload, so I was assigned to look into
solutions, of which I chose google cloud storage, another component of firebase. So now we're using firebase authentication,
firestore database, and google cloud storage. I created a small storage_examples.py file to demonstrate the funcitonality.

We have to finish off sprint 2, a little work left for backend, but still alot to go for frontend. With Janet assisting joseph, it
should come along more quickly. 

============================================================================================================================

Week 7

Since I finished connection management quite quickly, I took file uploading and downloading from Francis, since tasks had so many
user stories.

Although it was not much code at all, it took alot of time to implement and test correctly. For example, in file_upload, there were
issues with sending the files AND the data with the same route, so we had to break them up into two separate routes, which seems
very janky, but it appears to work. At this point in time, frontend has not called them yet so we shall see. Dabin helped alot
with file_upload, and for file_download, I spent alot of time just figuring out the correct args and sequencing of calls. 

All of backend funcitonality for sprint 2 is complete, we just have to wait on frontend implementation. This is top priority because
second demo is just around the corner. Sprint 3 also started several days ago, and I was tasked with workload as well as supply &
demand.

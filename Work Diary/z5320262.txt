Week 1

Group formed. I created my Jira account and joined the group. My role in the group is a developer.

We had an online meeting at Sunday 19th February @ 2PM. Went through: - how to use Jira
-Confirming our project
-Discussing system architecture, who is responsible for what
-Come up with an MVP.

We decided to use Python for backend, React for frontend and SQL for our databases.

An issue raised was that Joseph is the only person who has experience with frontend and that it'll be difficult for one person to work on frontend. It was decided that I will learn frontend during the term to help our frontend additonally with backend.

We gave ourselves the tasks of reading the scope of the project more throughly and maybe look through existing task management softwares. This is due week 2 Wednesday.

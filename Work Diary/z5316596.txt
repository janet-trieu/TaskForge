Week 1

I was absent to the tutorial on Week One but I was already acquainted with two of the group members, Dabin and Janet. Dabin filled me in and communicated on my behalf
during the tutorial and group formation where I would be joined by Vincent and Joseph. I contributed in choosing the name and Dabin was elected to be scrum master since he has
experience working with Jira and Kanban.

During the first meeting, we discussed our grievances including: to finalise our choice, questions regarding the specifications of the assignment and possible roles.
Questions unresolved would be asked to the tutor in Week 2. We planned to read the specifications more after the meeting to familarise ourselves and think of possible features
to implement in the project, including novel ideas which would be proposed to the tutor.

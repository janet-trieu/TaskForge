Week 1

I was absent to the tutorial on Week One but I was already acquainted with two of the group members, Dabin and Janet. Dabin filled me in and communicated on my behalf
during the tutorial and group formation where I would be joined by Vincent and Joseph. I contributed in choosing the name and Dabin was elected to be scrum master since he has
experience working with Jira and Kanban.

During the first meeting, we discussed our grievances including: to finalise our choice, questions regarding the specifications of the assignment and possible roles.
Questions unresolved would be asked to the tutor in Week 2. We planned to read the specifications more after the meeting to familarise ourselves and think of possible features
to implement in the project, including novel ideas which would be proposed to the tutor.

Week 2

We had our tutorial where we asked numerous questions regarding specifications of the assignment. Afterwards, we had another meeting in which we delegated tasks
in the proposal. I was tasked User Stories with Dabin. We also brainstormed additional features in which I contributed similar to spotify wrapped but morphed
into more Steam Achievements. 

After the meeting, I began working on the User stories but found the wording of Functionality/Objectives/Features confusing which would be brought up in the next meeting.
After finalising our definitons, I helped Dabin and Vincent with the User Stories by essentially translating our preconceived features.


Week 3

In our Tutorial we clarified more questions regarding to the proposal. We gained informative criticism specifically our novel functionality, Reputation. We brain stormed possible additions to Reputation and new ideas in general. One included Hardcore mode. 

I helped the User Stories, including making a visual supplementary diagram to assist the marker. This includes a product backlog, minimum viable product, and user stories. I also added the screenshots of the user stories in larger fonts for added visibility.

I also started on the formatting of the proposal. Including the title page, table of contents and spacing. I will add some references in APA style to finalise formatting.

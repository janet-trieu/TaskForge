### Week 1 ###

We formed our project group, and begun setup of Jira, Github, and a group chat for internal communication.
We held an online meeting and discussed the following:
- How to use Jira, or how "we" will use it
- Confirm our project, discuss everyone's experience with task managers
- Start delegation of task for Project Proposal
- Start looking into backend/frontend
- Grasp the overall scope of our project, possibly come up with our MVP (Minimum Viable Product)

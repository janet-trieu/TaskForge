General content:

    as well as a channel colled meeting outcome for the points discussed + responses
- set up Jira software, confluence (don't know if necessary)
- set up initial epic for Proposal, and the appropriate subtasks for it => background, user stories & sprints, and technical depth, scale, report formatting

- Group was formed on the first lab day, with premade members: Francis, Joseph, Janet and Vincent
- 3 ways of communication:
    - discord for online meetings (currently set for sunday afternoons)
    - Facebook messenger for general discussions/communications
    - use the time during + after the lab for in-person meetings/discussions
- Basic brainstorm & discussion towards: 
    - which project we are going to do => project 4 but not confirmed (task management system)
    - who is the scrum master => Myself
    - who is backend => Myself, Francis and Vincent
    - who is frontend => Joseph
    - **Janet is to flex around between backend and frontend
    - system architecture:
        - Python for backend
        - React for frontend
        - SQL for data storage/ database

What were the main technical and non-technical obstacles and how they were overcome (or what was tried and did not work)
- N/A, this is the first work diary entry

What was not finished, why this happened, how this affects the overall project progress and what adjustments (if any) are needed so the success of the project is not endangered

=== Week 2 ===

General content:
- set up jira x github integration

    Sprint 1: 1-14th of March

- created all the user stories for all the features planned so far

What was planned for the period since the last work diary entry
- Read up on the proposal and project 4 specifications

What was finished
- Everyone read on the proposal and project 4 speficiations, allowing us to start brainstorming our major features
- Jira and github setup complete
- With this in mind, we also started to delegate tasks regarding the proposal
    - background => Vincent
    - user stories + sprints => Myself + Francis
    - technical depth, scale, report formatting => Janet and Joseph

What were the main technical and non-technical obstacles and how they were overcome (or what was tried and did not work)
- for now, it is trying to get concrete times of when we can hold our online meeting, as everyone has different schedules
- Created a way for everyone to document their N/As => usual weekdays that everyone is busy, and also specific days where they have plans.

What was not finished, why this happened, how this affects the overall project progress and what adjustments (if any) are needed so the success of the project is not endangered
- Coming up with all 6 features
    - this can delay our proposal status
    + Adjustments: Everyone to brainstorm more features up until our next meeting on Sunday 26th, 2pm
    + Send our current feature list to our tutor for confirmation/help to see if we can split any existing features into 2

What is planned for the next period (e.g., next week)
- try to finish coming up with all the features + user stories
- try to complete the proposal (by mid week 3)
- discuss the questions sent over to the tutor
- start working on the project itself

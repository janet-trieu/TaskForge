=== Week 2 ===
What was planned for the period since the last work diary entry
- Read up on the proposal and project 4 specifications

What was finished
- Everyone read on the proposal and project 4 speficiations, allowing us to start brainstorming our major features
- Jira and github setup complete
- With this in mind, we also started to delegate tasks regarding the proposal
    - background => Vincent
    - user stories + sprints => Myself + Francis
    - technical depth, scale, report formatting => Janet and Joseph

What were the main technical and non-technical obstacles and how they were overcome (or what was tried and did not work)
- for now, it is trying to get concrete times of when we can hold our online meeting, as everyone has different schedules
- Created a way for everyone to document their N/As => usual weekdays that everyone is busy, and also specific days where they have plans.

What was not finished, why this happened, how this affects the overall project progress and what adjustments (if any) are needed so the success of the project is not endangered
- Coming up with all 6 features
    - this can delay our proposal status
    + Adjustments: Everyone to brainstorm more features up until our next meeting on Sunday 26th, 2pm
    + Send our current feature list to our tutor for confirmation/help to see if we can split any existing features into 2

What is planned for the next period (e.g., next week)
- try to finish all the features
- try to complete the proposal
- TBA from Sunday meeting
